Week 4: Build a Full-Stack Guestbook
Overview
This week you’ve been learning about clients and servers, and most importantly, how to get them to communicate with each other. In it’s most simple sense, a server hosts/collects data that the client will then display. You’ve been learning about the fundamentals of CRUD applications, which are a major part of being a web developer.

This week you’re going to make a ‘Guestbook’, like the ones in hotels, for users to leave a message for other users.

Make sure you take some time to look at the submission instructions, as they’re slightly different form previous weeks.

Stretch User Stories that I feel I completed

🐿️ As a user, I want additional functionality on the form such as form validation so that I can have a more interactive experience when submitting my information.
🐿️ As a user, I would like to be able to delete posts.

On this whole assignment I found myself struggling more and more a time went on, because the lessons are short and there is a lot of information to take in, I felt lost a lot of the time and found that I was having to revisit a lot of content and study the code in finer detail.

the basic functionality of the website was easy enough after this, I did have some issues with URLs around my code as it was only making work with the root of the supabase and not actually a /directory. not sure what happened there and I didn't get to the bottom of that. Despite that the website looks and works how you would imagine it would.
